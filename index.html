<p><b>Server Backup Monitoring Dashboard: </b>Business Context</p>
<p><b>Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The stakeholders needed a real-time dashboard to track which servers restarted successfully, which ones failed and monitor backup status to ensure availability.
</li>
<li>Their existing reporting tool was limited, required heavy manual effort, and slowed down incident detection for the monitoring team.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>My Role</b></p>
<p><b>Data Sources / ETL</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed the dashboard based on client requirements.</li>
<li>Collaborated with stakeholders to define KPIs for server health and backup availability.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>SQL database of HP server hosts.</li>
<li>Connected via DirectQuery for live, dynamic reporting.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>clearer visuals and critical metrics for incident detection.</p>
<p><b>90%</b></p>
<p><b>Reduction in Manual Reporting</b></p>
<p>Eliminated manual reporting on the whole project</p>
<p><b>5x</b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Security Operations Dashboard</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Security Operations Dashboard: </b></p>
<p>Business Context</p>
<p><b>Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The security team was responsible for sending monthly reports to executives, but the process was entirely manual. Preparing the slides often took several days of effort.</li>
<li>The reports were static and lacked flexibility, executives couldn’t easily filter by specific months or look back at historical data without requesting additional files.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>My Role</b></p>
<p><b>Data Sources / ETL</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed a new dashboard tailored to the team’s reporting needs, focusing on automation and interactivity.</li>
<li>Optimized an existing dashboard by improving its structure and correcting KPI calculations using DAX measures to ensure data accuracy.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Data was provided through monthly Excel extracts sent by the security team.</li>
<li>The files were cleaned and transformed in Power Query before being modeled in Power BI.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>50% Automation</b></p>
<p>Reduced the team’s end-of-month reporting workload, </p>
<p>allowing them to focus on higher-value security tasks instead of manual reporting.</p>
<p><b>Introduced</b></p>
<p>dynamic features such as slicers for date and month selection, </p>
<p>enabling executives  to easily drill into past performance without needing separate reports.</p>
<p><b>Improved</b></p>
<p>overall accessibility, eliminating the inefficiencies of tracking outdated versions of the report.</p>
<p><b>Impact / Outcome</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change, SLA &amp; Backlog Dashboard</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Problem 1</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>SLA measurements in ServiceNow were often incorrect because the developers responsible for maintaining them did not implement the necessary adjustments. </li>
<li>To avoid delays and repeated back-and-forth requests, we needed to create our own accurate version of SLA reporting.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Problems 2 &amp; 3</b></p>
<p><b>Problem 4</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholder teams were not highly communicative or organized, which meant that even small updates could take weeks to be implemented.</li>
<li>ServiceNow’s built-in reporting was too basic and limited, and some required measurements could not be created directly in the tool.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholders wanted a more reliable and visually clear reporting solution that allowed them to track SLAs and tickets anytime without depending on manual updates.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change, SLA &amp; Backlog Dashboard: </b></p>
<p>Business Context (Problems)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change, SLA &amp; Backlog Dashboard: </b></p>
<p>Business Context (Solutions)</p>
<p><b>My Role</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed an intuitive Power BI dashboard to present SLA metrics and KPIs requested by stakeholders.</li>
<li>Created custom DAX measures to replicate and correct SLA calculations, ensuring data was both accurate and live.</li>
<li>Adapted the design and color scheme to stakeholder preferences, focusing on simplicity and readability rather than flashy visuals.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Data Sources/ ETL</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Configured scheduled ServiceNow data extractions that were automatically delivered to Outlook.</li>
<li>Set up Power Automate to sync Outlook with SharePoint, ensuring each new extraction replaced the previous file seamlessly and on daily basis.</li>
<li>Connected Power BI to SharePoint so the report stayed updated automatically without requiring manual refreshes or SQL/API setup.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Impact / Outcome</b></p>
<p><b>Delivered</b></p>
<p>a fully automated reporting process, removing the need for manual  intervention or complex SQL/API integrations.</p>
<p><b>Over <u>10</u> executives </b></p>
<p>used the dashboard daily, making it a trusted tool for SLA and ticket tracking.</p>
<p><b>Helped</b></p>
<p>executives keep weekly meetings on schedule by providing accurate, timely insights, unlike the old static reports that often caused delays.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change &amp; SLA Tables Dashboard</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Situations 1 &amp; 2 </b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The IT team needed an automated reporting solution to present accurate metrics to multiple stakeholders.</li>
<li>All stakeholders used the same ticketing tool, which often caused data overlaps, mixed reports, and in some cases, incorrect information.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Situations 3 &amp; 4</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>During monthly reviews, the IT team had to manually prepare over 8 different PowerPoint decks, each tailored to a specific stakeholder’s metrics. This was time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
<li>Stakeholders insisted on reports being presented in table format similar to Excel, even though Power BI is not natively optimized for Excel-style layouts.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change &amp; SLA Tables Dashboard: </b></p>
<p>Business Context (Problems)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>My Role</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed an intuitive Power BI dashboard that replicated SLA and KPI reports in a clean, Excel-like format.</li>
<li>Built a Project slicer to differentiate each stakeholder’s company data, ensuring that all visuals, logos, and metrics dynamically adjusted based on the selected project.</li>
<li>Enabled stakeholders to use the same report but view it in a personalized way depending on the project selection.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Data Sources/ ETL</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Used raw Excel extractions provided by IT teams.</li>
<li>Cleaned and transformed data in Power Query before building the model in Power BI.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Incident, Request, Change &amp; SLA Tables Dashboard: </b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Impact / Outcome</b></p>
<p><b>Delivered</b></p>
<p>a simple, user-friendly dashboard that looked and functioned almost exactly  like stakeholders’ familiar Excel tables by mimicking the pivot tables, easing adoption.</p>
<p><b>Saved</b></p>
<p>the IT team hours of manual effort each </p>
<p>month by eliminating the need to filter massive Excel extracts and </p>
<p>build 8 separate stakeholder-specific versions.</p>
<p><b>Standardized</b></p>
<p>reporting timelines and all stakeholders now receive their reports on the same day each month, ensuring consistency and better meeting preparation.</p>
